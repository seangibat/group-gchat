A simple Google App Engine chatroom made to learn Python and asynchronous communication.

As authentication is handled by the GAE Users API, it is essentially group gchat.

Rooms can be entered or new rooms can be created by adding case-sensitive text after the slash e.g. http://groupgchat.com/test or http://groupgchat.com/peopleMan.
